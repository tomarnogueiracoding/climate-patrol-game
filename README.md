## Introduction

Game created for the first project on Ironhack Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp. Climate change was the inspiration for the game. My main goal for the project was working with a lot of diferent collisions and outcomes. Using canvas and Vanilla JS, the biggest challenge was creating the game engine and randomize elements.
